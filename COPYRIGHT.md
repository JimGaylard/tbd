Files in this repository don't list author names, both to avoid clutter and to avoid having to keep the lists up to date.
Instead, your name will appear in the change log and in the CONTRIBUTORS file and perhaps the AUTHORS file.

The CONTRIBUTORS file defines who the contributors—the people—are; the AUTHORS file defines who “The TBD Authors”—the copyright holders—are. The TBD developers will update these files when submitting your first change.
In order for them to do that, you need to have completed one of the contributor license agreements:

    If you are the copyright holder, you will need to agree to the individual contributor license agreement, which can be completed online.
    If your organization is the copyright holder, the organization will need to agree to the corporate contributor license agreement.

This needs to be done only for your first submission.

Files in the repository are copyright the year they are added, and licenced under the MIT licence.
